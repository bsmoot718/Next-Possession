##  Project Overview

**Next Possession** focuses on two key playoff performers from the 2025 NBA postseason:
- **Jalen Brunson (Guard)** – New York Knicks  
- **Karl-Anthony Towns (Big)** – Minnesota Timberwolves

It uses real-inspired data to simulate how player development staff might:
- Track player performance game-by-game
- Benchmark against elite standards for their position
- Identify growth areas and link them to actionable drills

## 📊 Dashboard Features

- **Player Selector**  
  Choose between Brunson or Towns to explore their playoff journey.

- **Radar Chart**  
  Visual comparison of the player's skill metrics vs. elite benchmarks in:
  - Scoring
  - Motor
  - Decision Making
  - Defense
  - Shooting
  - Versatility

- **Game-by-Game Trendline**  
  View how the player's scoring evolved throughout the playoffs.

- **Drill Recommendation Engine**  
  Automatically suggests development drills based on skill gaps vs. benchmark.

## 🔧 Tools & Tech

- **Python** (pandas, plotly, Streamlit)
- **Streamlit Cloud** for deployment
- Custom-built CSVs simulating Cerebro/NOAH-style performance data

## 💡 Why It Matters

This project bridges the gap between **advanced analytics** and **on-court skill development**. By aligning performance data with coaching insight, it shows how data science can drive individualized growth strategies for elite athletes — exactly the kind of thinking expected in basketball ops and player dev roles.

## 📩 Built For

This prototype was created as part of my application for the **Data Scientist – Basketball** role at **Overtime Elite**, and will be showcased at the **Atlanta Sports & Entertainment Career Fair** hosted by the Atlanta Dream on June 21.

## 🧠 Next Steps (v2 Roadmap)

- Integrate real data via `nba_api` or Cerebro API
- Add video clip linking for key possessions
- Include PDF export for coaching reports
- Expand to multiple player archetypes and teams
